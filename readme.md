# My personal website
![Preview image](https://montydawson.co.uk/Static.png)

I decided to simplify my website - the first version was basically a job advert in code. I also wanted to explore webpack a little further - look into things like service workers for offline availability and just play around with some SCSS and design ideas.

## Future work
- Rewrite the JS in TypeScript.
- Add more easter eggs.

## Installation
Clone, make sure you have node installed, then:
```
npm install
npm start
```
